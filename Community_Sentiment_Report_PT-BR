User feedback:

"As a traditional software architect, although I've read a lot of the documentation, I think a demonstration of the Symbol network's potentials would be very worthwhile, as well as a "Hello World" from the SDK. You could massively use YouTube (for example) as a platform to spread my suggestions.

In short: "Lack of marketing!"
